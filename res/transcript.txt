including the names of the key stages you may want to watch this video first to refresh your memory of how mitosis works you should already know that mitosis is a process of cell division that produces identical copies of cells and is involved in growth salary pay and
reproduction when cells divide by mitosis the number of cells increases and hence the organism grows different organisms have different numbers of chromosomes to keep it simple we are just going to look at what happens to one pair of chromosomes during
cell division before we start just a quick reminder that a chromosome is made up of two chromatids and one from the mother and one from the father so mitosis with our special signs and names add in to this day I just remember it meant to
which order the stages go in then just take cytokinesis into the end interface the chromosomes duplicate and become two identical chromatids joined at the centromere so in humans it has gone from the original 46 to 92
in prophase in the nucleus the chromosomes condensed and in the cytoplasm spindle fibers form metaphase the nuclear membrane breaks apart the spindle fiber is attached to the chromosomes and the chromosomes line up at the
anaphase the spindle fibers shortened and the centromere device so that each chromosome becomes two separate chromatids telophase the nuclear membrane forms from each set of chromosomes chromosomes spread back out in the new nucleus
spindle fibers breakdown in humans each nucleus has the normal 46 chromosomes again cytokinesis the cell membrane pinches into two separate sets of chromatids into two identical daughter cells with the same number of chromosomes as the parent
46 or 23 pairs in humans so there we have house cells divide by mitosis to form two new identical cells with the special it meant science words included
