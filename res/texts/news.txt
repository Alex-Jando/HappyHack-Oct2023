For the second time in as many weeks, the City of Vancouver's integrity commissioner has ruled on a code of conduct complaint filed by Mayor Ken Sim against Coun. Christine Boyle.

Unlike the first time – when commissioner Lisa Southern found Boyle had not violated the code of conduct by disclosing how she voted in an in-camera meeting – this one was resolved in Sim's favour. 

The complaint concerned an email Boyle sent and a post she shared on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, which Sim said denigrated Harrison Fleming, who had recently joined the mayor's staff.

The mayor's complaint alleged that Boyle "endorsed a tweet and wrote an email targeting a newly hired member (Harrison Fleming) of the mayor’s office accusing him directly of past bullying and implying that he has advanced and is complicit in anti-LGBTQ+ government policies, despite the staff member identifying as a gay man," as quoted in Southern's decision(opens in a new tab).
